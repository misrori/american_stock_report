Here you can see how the price of stocks were changed within 5 days. 
The prices compared always with the first day. 
For example if you see the title is 20 days. Than it will show the total changes frow 20 working days before.  


5 days before
```{r}
tozsde_plot(number_of_days = 5, my_adatom = adatom_teljes)
```


20 days before
```{r}
tozsde_plot(number_of_days = 20, my_adatom = adatom_teljes)
```
